    **Why did you get involved in Derby?** Got involved with Roller Derby as spent a year watching the wife skate around and I wanted to be involved.

    **Things that annoy me?** People that don't give 100% and excuses.

    **Likes:** When I can see determination and passion in people, teamwork and cats and anything nerdy.

    **Favourite food:** Asian.

    **Favourite quote:** "Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!" -- Rocky Balboa

    **Why did you start playing Derby?** I watched my first bout in 2010 and had no idea what was going on but knew instantly I HAD to play. I couldn't even stand in skates but I have been dreaming of playing a contact sport like this since birth.

    **Likes:** Food, singing, dancing, making people smile and of course my two mental pugs!

    **Favourite Food(s):** I love it all! Ok not really -- I dislike peas, pepper, satay sauce and beetroot.

    **Favourite quote or motto:** "Dream it; love it; live it"... and ... BOOM!!

    **Likes:** Derby obviously and sport, music, movies, "dancing and singing" like an idiot & time with friends/family

    I have two.

      1. "Make your own kind of music" -- Mamas & the Papas
      2. "Live hard, die pretty" (I don't know if I made it up or stole it!)

    **Why did you start playing Derby:** I saw a picture on Instagram of a pair of skates, and words that said "My Roller Derby Wife"; I was intrigued.

    **Favorite quote:** "Life is like a camera, just focus on what's important and capture the good times, develop from the negatives and if things don't work out, just take another shot"

    **Why did you start playing Derby?** I grew up skating in the Xanadu era and had a roller rink just around the corner so spent a lot of time there. A few years ago I got given a shiny pair of Starfires, saw Whip It, and thought it was a great way to get back into skating. It's taken a bit of time to get the Kira out, but I think it's been knocked out of me now.

    **What annoys you the most?** Rudeness and dirt.

    **Likes:** Sunshine, travelling and time to do nothing.

    **Favourite Food:** Cheese, and pretty much all baked goods.

    **Favourite quote or motto:** I'm not sure if it's original but it was shared by a local Manly surfer a lifetime ago and it's stuck with me... "Through time and space, the dream of endless perfection".

    **Why did you start playing Derby?** I have wanted to play derby since I watched it at the Horden a few years ago and when I found out there was a local NB team, I thought my time has come!

    **What annoys you the most?** Not much, it is all good.

    **Likes:** My family, playing roller derby (I hope), travel and pirate jokes (they never get old).

    **Favourite Food(s):** The potato in all its forms.

    **Favourite quote or motto:** There are two types of situations the life threatening and the inconvenient, this is just inconvenient.

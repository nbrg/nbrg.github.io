  **Why did you start playing Derby?** A friend took me to a bout for my birthday. By the first skate-out I was hooked. By the first hit on a Jammer I knew it would become an obsession. It has.

  **What annoys you the most?** Being sick or injured, ignorance, insincerity & lying.

  **Likes:** Derby obviously and sport, music, movies, "dancing and singing" like an idiot & time with friends/family

  **Favourite Food(s):** Anything my Mum cooks when I go over for dinner! I don't cook, so for me NOTHING beats a home cooked meal.

  **Favourite quote or motto:**

  I have two.

    1. "Make your own kind of music" -- Mamas & the Papas
    2. "Live hard, die pretty" (I don't know if I made it up or stole it!)

  **Why did you start playing Derby?** After seeing a bout held at Homebush, I fell in love with the sport! Within weeks of seeing the bout, I saw an article in The Manly Daily about NBRG and the rest is history. I've never looked back!

  **What annoys you the most?** Incompetent drivers and rudeness.

  **Likes:** Surfing, stand up paddle boarding, watching extreme sports and dancing like a rock star.

  **Favourite Food(s):** Thai and gelato.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!"

  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I have wanted to play derby since I watched it at the Horden a few years ago and when I found out there was a local NB team, I thought my time has come!

  **What annoys you the most?** Not much, it is all good.

  **Likes:** My family, playing roller derby (I hope), travel and pirate jokes (they never get old).

  **Favourite Food(s):** The potato in all its forms.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** There are two types of situations the life threatening and the inconvenient, this is just inconvenient.

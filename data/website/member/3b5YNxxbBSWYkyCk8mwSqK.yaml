  **Why did you start playing Derby:** Always loved to skate. Don't like netball.

  **What annoys you the most:** Mismatched clothes pegs.

  **Likes:** (obviously) skating, horse riding, eating, cleaning, renovating.

  **Favourite food:** Vege lasagne or an old school roast dinner. Bananas as long as they have no spots on them yet... and pretty much all unripe fruit. Cheesecake, apple pie, chocolate.... And those delicious little dumplings they steam at Asian food places.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** "Everyone was thinking it... I just said it"

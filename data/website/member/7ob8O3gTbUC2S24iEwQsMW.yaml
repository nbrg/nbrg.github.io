  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I grew up skating in the Xanadu era and had a roller rink just around the corner so spent a lot of time there. A few years ago I got given a shiny pair of Starfires, saw Whip It, and thought it was a great way to get back into skating. It's taken a bit of time to get the Kira out, but I think it's been knocked out of me now.

  **What annoys you the most?** Rudeness and dirt.

  **Likes:** Sunshine, travelling and time to do nothing.

  **Favourite Food:** Cheese, and pretty much all baked goods.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** I'm not sure if it's original but it was shared by a local Manly surfer a lifetime ago and it's stuck with me... "Through time and space, the dream of endless perfection".

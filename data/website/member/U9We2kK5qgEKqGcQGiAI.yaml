  **Why did you start playing Derby?** Because I loved skating and thought the possibility of being a derby girl was too cool to pass up

  **Likes:** Baking and Sleeping in

  **What annoys me the most:** The high risk of injury in this sport. It's sad when passionate players can't play any more

  **Favourite Food:** Burgers and anything that's a Dessert

  **Favourite Quote:** "I may not be the coolest, I may not be the best, but there will never be another footprint on the earth quite the same as mine." -- Atmosphere

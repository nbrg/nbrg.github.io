  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I watched my first bout in 2010 and had no idea what was going on but knew instantly I HAD to play. I couldn't even stand in skates but I have been dreaming of playing a contact sport like this since birth.

  **What annoys you the most?** A negative attitude and Cow chewing (people that chew with their mouth open whilst making noise).

  **Likes:** Food, singing, dancing, making people smile and of course my two mental pugs!

  **Favourite Food(s):** I love it all! Ok not really -- I dislike peas, pepper, satay sauce and beetroot.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** "Dream it; love it; live it"... and ... BOOM!!

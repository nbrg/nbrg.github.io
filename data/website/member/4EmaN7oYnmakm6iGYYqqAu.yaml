  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I had recently moved to Sydney and I wanted to meet new people. A friend of mine back home kept going on and on about roller derby so I finally looked it up. There was an intake two weeks later in Sydney and I thought, "I don't know how to roller skate but that sounds ridiculously exciting!" And, four years later, I'm still hooked.

  **Likes:** bicycle riding, tea drinking, photograph taking, wine drinking, ocean swimming, book reading, world traveling and so on...

  **Favourite Foods:** Mexican anything with heaps of cheese & good ol' American mac & cheese

  **Favourite quote or motto:** "When I see an adult on a bicycle, I do not despair for the future of the human race." -- H.G. Wells

  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I finally found a sport that suits my personality, I can get out all my aggression, and all the girls are awesome.

  **What annoys you most?** Tardiness, liars, and when it rains on my days off work.

  **Likes:** Eating, relaxing in the sun, singing in the car and shower, and doing art and craft with my daughter Charlotte

  **Favorite foods:** Mexican, Pad Thai and Sushi.

  **Favorite quote:** "It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do."

  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I have always loved skating, and I found roller derby at a time when I needed to make a fresh start after marriage breakdown.

  **What annoys you the most?** Bitchiness, negativity, and petty, narrow minded people.

  **Likes:** Skating; camping; creating beautiful things from steel; my car; my home, and my gorgeous kids.

  **Favourite Food:** Beef jerky... and beer.

  **Favourite quote:** "Some people live more in 20 years than others do in 80. It's not the time that matters, it's the person." Dr Who

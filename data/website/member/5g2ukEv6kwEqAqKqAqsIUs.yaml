  **Why you started playing Derby?** It sounded like fun, I love a challenge and I have anger management issues...

  **What annoys you the most?** Inconsiderate jerks and people who are crap to the environment

  **Likes:** Making people laugh. Derby. Being in, on or around the water

  **Favourite Food:** Potato in all forms, followed closely by popcorn

  **Favourite quote or motto:** If you can't be a good example -- just be a horrible warning.

  **Why did you start playing Derby:** I saw a picture on Instagram of a pair of skates, and words that said "My Roller Derby Wife"; I was intrigued. As a kid I was on my skates my whole youth and loved it that much. It brought back so many great memories that I thought "Well I'm game to get back on my skates, why the hell not?!"

  **What annoys you the most?** When bad things happen to good people...

  **Likes:** Other than derby! Photography, spending time with my kids, skating, playing my ukulele, listening to music and singing out loud. Horse riding and antique furniture scouting/shopping. Any thing vintage...

  **Favourite Food:** Can I say food (s) ?!... Red Wine with homemade lasagna, gin and tonic on a summers day, sashimi and great black coffee but not together lol

  **Favorite quote:** "Life is like a camera, just focus on what's important and capture the good times, develop from the negatives and if things don't work out, just take another shot"

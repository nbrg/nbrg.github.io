  **Why did you start playing Derby?** I skated as a kid -- always. I picked it back up in 2003 and loved it. Then I went to a bout and started practicing more. During one of my skates I met another girl on skates (that'd be Wrecks!) then we told two friends etc... We were able to form the Northern Beaches Roller Girls and now the rest is history!

  **What annoys you the most:** People who judge -- walk a mile in my shoes!

  **Likes:** Red wine, food and sleep.

  **Favourite Food(s):** Steak, definitely steak and other things not so good for you like mash and heaps of gravy. I like truffles and grilled salmon. Basically I like food -- not too picky.

  **Favourite quote or motto:** "You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do." -- Henry Ford

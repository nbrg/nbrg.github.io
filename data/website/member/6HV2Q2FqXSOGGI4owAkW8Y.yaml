  **Why did you start playing roller derby?** I've skating since I was 4 years old with a break due to been a teenager and Roller Skating no longer been cool in the 90's. My best memories are skating the streets where I grew up. After been in Oz for 2 months 'Whip It' came on the TV and I hit the Web to fine Leagues. I joined CCRG 1 month later and transferred to NBRG which is much closer to my home.

  **What annoys you the most?** Too many things annoy me to list (I am a whinging Pom) My husband and my kids (I love them but yeah them)

  **Likes:** Planning events, anything creative. I love Karaoke (I am a brunette Britney...when I'm drunk) To clear things up, I am the best singer in the world. (delusional Simon Cowell says) What does he know?

  **Favourite foods:** Steak (well done/burnt)

  **Favourite quote or saying:** "Chocolate makes my clothes shrink"

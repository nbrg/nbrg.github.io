      **Why did you get involved in Derby?** When my partner, Yorkshire Terror, had her first game in May 2014 I came along out of being a supportive partner and a small amount of curiosity, and didn't really know what I was getting myself into. One confusing and dizzying game later I was immediately hooked on the sport, and quickly started figuring out how it worked (I like puzzles). Learning about how inclusive and awesome the community and sport is just cemented the whole thing for me, and fast forward a year and I'm a lineup manager and spend way too much of my time thinking about Derby.

      **Things which annoy me:** Inefficiency. Wilful ignorance. Gender stereotyping, and societal norms.

      **Likes:** Rational thought. Insatiable curiosity. Making things.

      **Favourite food:** Coffee. Cocktails. Beer. Any food which compliments those things.

      **Favourite quote:** "He attacked everything in life with a mix of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence, and it was often difficult to tell which was which." -- Douglas Adams

      **Why did you start playing Derby:** I saw a picture on Instagram of a pair of skates, and words that said "My Roller Derby Wife"; I was intrigued. As a kid I was on my skates my whole youth and loved it that much. It brought back so many great memories that I thought "Well I'm game to get back on my skates, why the hell not?!"

      **What annoys you the most?** When bad things happen to good people...

      **Likes:** Other than derby! Photography, spending time with my kids, skating, playing my ukulele, listening to music and singing out loud. Horse riding and antique furniture scouting/shopping. Any thing vintage...

      **Favourite Food:** Can I say food (s) ?!... Red Wine with homemade lasagna, gin and tonic on a summers day, sashimi and great black coffee but not together lol

      **Favorite quote:** "Life is like a camera, just focus on what's important and capture the good times, develop from the negatives and if things don't work out, just take another shot"

      **Why did you start playing Derby?** I grew up skating in the Xanadu era and had a roller rink just around the corner so spent a lot of time there. A few years ago I got given a shiny pair of Starfires, saw Whip It, and thought it was a great way to get back into skating. It's taken a bit of time to get the Kira out, but I think it's been knocked out of me now.

      **What annoys you the most?** Rudeness and dirt.

      **Likes:** Sunshine, travelling and time to do nothing.

      **Favourite Food:** Cheese, and pretty much all baked goods.

      **Favourite quote or motto:** I'm not sure if it's original but it was shared by a local Manly surfer a lifetime ago and it's stuck with me... "Through time and space, the dream of endless perfection".

      **Why did you get involved in Derby?** Got involved with Roller Derby as spent a year watching the wife skate around and I wanted to be involved.

      **Things that annoy me?** People that don't give 100% and excuses.

      **Likes:** When I can see determination and passion in people, teamwork and cats and anything nerdy.

      **Favourite food:** Asian.

      **Favourite quote:** "Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!" -- Rocky Balboa

      **Why did you get involved in Derby?** When my partner, Yorkshire Terror, had her first game in May 2014 I came along out of being a supportive partner and a small amount of curiosity, and didn't really know what I was getting myself into. One confusing and dizzying game later I was immediately hooked on the sport, and quickly started figuring out how it worked (I like puzzles). Learning about how inclusive and awesome the community and sport is just cemented the whole thing for me, and fast forward a year and I'm a lineup manager and spend way too much of my time thinking about Derby.

      **Things which annoy me:** Inefficiency. Wilful ignorance. Gender stereotyping, and societal norms.

      **Likes:** Rational thought. Insatiable curiosity. Making things.

      **Favourite food:** Coffee. Cocktails. Beer. Any food which compliments those things.

      **Favourite quote:** "He attacked everything in life with a mix of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence, and it was often difficult to tell which was which." -- Douglas Adams

      **Why did you start playing roller derby?** I've skating since I was 4 years old with a break due to been a teenager and Roller Skating no longer been cool in the 90's. My best memories are skating the streets where I grew up. After been in Oz for 2 months 'Whip It' came on the TV and I hit the Web to fine Leagues. I joined CCRG 1 month later and transferred to NBRG which is much closer to my home.

      **What annoys you the most?** Too many things annoy me to list (I am a whinging Pom) My husband and my kids (I love them but yeah them)

      **Likes:** Planning events, anything creative. I love Karaoke (I am a brunette Britney...when I'm drunk) To clear things up, I am the best singer in the world. (delusional Simon Cowell says) What does he know?

      **Favourite foods:** Steak (well done/burnt)

      **Favourite quote or saying:** "Chocolate makes my clothes shrink"

      **Why did you start playing Derby?** A friend took me to a bout for my birthday. By the first skate-out I was hooked. By the first hit on a Jammer I knew it would become an obsession. It has.

      **What annoys you the most?** Being sick or injured, ignorance, insincerity & lying.

      **Likes:** Derby obviously and sport, music, movies, "dancing and singing" like an idiot & time with friends/family

      **Favourite Food(s):** Anything my Mum cooks when I go over for dinner! I don't cook, so for me NOTHING beats a home cooked meal.

      **Favourite quote or motto:**

      I have two.

        1. "Make your own kind of music" -- Mamas & the Papas
        2. "Live hard, die pretty" (I don't know if I made it up or stole it!)

      **Why did you start playing Derby:** I saw a picture on Instagram of a pair of skates, and words that said "My Roller Derby Wife"; I was intrigued.

      **Why did you start playing Derby?** I had recently moved to Sydney and I wanted to meet new people. A friend of mine back home kept going on and on about roller derby so I finally looked it up.

      **Why did you start playing Derby?** I grew up skating in the Xanadu era and had a roller rink just around the corner so spent a lot of time there.

      **What annoys you the most?** Rudeness and dirt.

      **Likes:** Sunshine, travelling and time to do nothing.

    **Why did you start playing roller derby?** I've skating since I was 4 years old with a break due to been a teenager and Roller Skating no longer been cool in the 90's. My best memories are skating the streets where I grew up. After been in Oz for 2 months 'Whip It' came on the TV and I hit the Web to fine Leagues. I joined CCRG 1 month later and transferred to NBRG which is much closer to my home.

    **What annoys you the most?** Too many things annoy me to list (I am a whinging Pom) My husband and my kids (I love them but yeah them)

    **Likes:** Planning events, anything creative. I love Karaoke (I am a brunette Britney…when I'm drunk) To clear things up, I am the best singer in the world. (delusional Simon Cowell says) What does he know?

    **Favourite foods:** Steak (well done/burnt)

    **Favourite quote or saying:** "Chocolate makes my clothes shrink"

    **Why did you start playing derby?** I grew up skating in the Xanadu era and had a roller rink just around the corner so spent a lot of time there. A few years ago I got given a shiny pair of Starfires, saw Whip It, and thought it was a great way to get back into skating. It's taken a bit of time to get the Kira out, but I think it's been knocked out of me now.

    **What annoys you the most?** Rudeness and dirt. 

    **Likes:** Sunshine, travelling and time to do nothing.

    **Favourite Food:** Cheese, and pretty much all baked goods.

    **Favourite quote or motto:** I'm not sure if it's original but it was shared by a local Manly surfer a lifetime ago and it's stuck with me... "Through time and space, the dream of endless perfection".

    **Why did you get involved in Roller Derby?** When my partner, Yorkshire Terror, had her first game in May 2014 I came along out of being a supportive partner and a small amount of curiosity, and didn't really know what I was getting myself into. One confusing and dizzying game later I was immediately hooked on the sport, and quickly started figuring out how it worked (I like puzzles). Learning about how inclusive and awesome the community and sport is just cemented the whole thing for me, and fast forward a year and I'm a lineup manager and spend way too much of my time thinking about Derby.

    **Things that annoy me:** Inefficiency. Wilful ignorance. Gender stereotyping, and societal norms.

    **Likes:** Rational thought. Insatiable curiosity. Making things.

    **Favourite food:** Coffee. Cocktails. Beer. Any food which compliments those things.

    **Favourite quote:** "He attacked everything in life with a mix of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence, and it was often difficult to tell which was which." -- Douglas Adams

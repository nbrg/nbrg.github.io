# Want to play Roller Derby?

Ahoy there mateys! So you fancy joining this band of merry rollers, for more information and to join our mailing list please contact: [join@nbrg.com.au](mailto:join@nbrg.com.au)

We run recruitment drives twice a year, available for every skill level, all you have to be is 18+. If you’ve never skated before we will teach you. We have two groups:

**Freshmeat** -- basic roller skating and roller derby skills – cross-overs, stopping, falling, pack work, blocking, skating agility, some hitting.

**League** -- a mix of skaters who have passed WFTDA minimum skills and are getting ready to bout or actively bouting.

N.B. All referees must pass Freshmeat to skate with NBRG.

If you’d rather walk the plank than strap 8 wheels to your feet, that’s cool, we are always in need of more Non-Skating Officials. There are lots of rules in Derby so officials play a big role in making it all come together.

We also accept WFTDA minimal skills passed skaters from other leagues. Please email [join@nbrg.com.au](mailto:join@nbrg.com.au) to discuss transferring.

# Junior Rollers

Northern Beaches Junior Rollers offers a positive environment for young people aged 5-17 years to develop skating skills & improve fitness while playing the sport of flat track Roller Derby!

The JRDA does not have any age limits for skaters â€“ we separate skaters using skill levels, rather than age, because we have found that individual ability is often very different within any age group.

Derby is great because it allows people of all sizes and body types to compete.
